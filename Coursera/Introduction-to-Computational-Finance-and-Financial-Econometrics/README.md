##Course Goals and Objectives
The course will emphasize the transition from an economic model of asset return behavior to an econometric model using real data. This transition involves (1) specification of an economic model; (2) estimation of an econometric model; (3) testing of the assumptions of the econometric model; (4) testing the implications of the economic model; (5) forecasting from the econometric model. The modeling process requires the use of economic theory, probability models, optimization techniques, and statistical analysis.

By the end of this course, you will be able to

perform asset return calculations;
measure risk; and
construct optimized portfolios using the open source R programming language and Microsoft Excel.
You will learn how to

build probability models for asset returns;
apply statistical techniques to evaluate if asset returns are normally distributed;
use Monte Carlo simulation and bootstrapping techniques to evaluate statistical models; and
use optimization methods to construct efficient portfolios.

##Course Prerequisites
The ideal prerequisites are a year of calculus (through partial differentiation and constrained optimization using Lagrange multipliers); some familiarity with matrix algebra; a course in probability and statistics using calculus; intermediate microeconomics; some exposure to a programming language (preferably object oriented); and an interest in financial economics

##Technology Requirements
To complete this course successfully, you will need to have regular access to a computer with a high-speed internet connection capable of playing videos. In addition, the course will use R for data analysis and statistical modeling and Microsoft Excel for spreadsheet modeling.

R is a free, open-source statistical modeling and graphical analysis language built upon the S language developed at Bell Labs. We will be using several user-created packages (libraries or R functions) specifically designed for the analysis of financial time series data. R packages are maintained on the web and can be automatically downloaded from with R.

Since R has a rather steep learning curve, you will use the web-based platform DataCamp for all R assignments in this course. DataCamp is an online interactive learning platform that offers free R tutorials through learning-by-doing. It breaks the different programming assignments down into many short exercises, and provides you with hints and instant feedback on how to perform even better. This helps you to understand deeply what is going on, even if you are a novice to programming.

If you do not have Microsoft Excel or do not wish to purchase it, open-source spreadsheet software is available from open openoffice.org. However, the course and assignments will assume students are using Excel.
