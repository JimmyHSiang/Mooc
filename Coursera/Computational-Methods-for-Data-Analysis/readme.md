##Computational Methods for Data Analysis

###Course Outline:
####Review of Statistics: (1 week)
We will begin with a brief review of statistical methods. The principles of statistics will be largely applied in a computational context for extracting meaningful information from data.
mean, variance, moments
probability distributions
significance testing, hypothesis testing
####Spectral and Time-Frequency Analysis: (4 weeks)
We will introduce the ideas of signal processing, filtering, time-frequency representations including wavelet expansions. Our application will be largely to problems in image processing, denoising and noise reduction.
digital signal processing
noise reduction and filtering
image processing and face recognition
time-frequency methods and wavelets
####Objective Analysis Techniques: (5 weeks)
These methods are practical attempts to reduce the dimensionality of the data as well as infer statistically meaningful trends in what otherwise appears to be noisy data.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
Emperical Mode Decomposition (EMD)
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
