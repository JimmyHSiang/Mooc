##Nanodegree Structure

These are the projects you'll build and the classes that will prepare you to build each of the projects.
You'll have access to all these in the Nanodegree:

###PROJECT Portfolio Mockup to HTML

You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS.
You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio 
projects you will complete throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

Prepare for this project with: *Intro to HTML and CSS and Responsive Web Design Fundamentals*

###PROJECT Interactive Resume

You will develop an interactive resume application that reads your resume content from a JSON file and dynamically
displays that content within a provided template. You will use objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures
to compose the content that will display on the resume.

Prepare for this project with: *JavaScript Basics and Intro to jQuery*

###PROJECT Classic Arcade Game Clone

You will be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to 
the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

Prepare for this project with: *Object-Oriented JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas*

###PROJECT Website Optimization

You will optimize a provided website with a number of optimization- and performance-related issues so that it achieves
a target PageSpeed score and runs at 60 frames per second.

Prepare for this project with: *Website Performance Optimization*

###PROJECT Neighborhood Map

You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit.
You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or
places you’d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing
of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of
these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

Prepare for this project with: *Intro to AJAX and JavaScript Design Patterns*

###PROJECT Feed Reader Testing

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly
saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately,
they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's
where you come in.

Prepare for this project with: *JavaScript Testing* coming soon!

###Additional Projects

You’ll host all your projects on GitHub and make regular commits. If you haven’t learned version control yet, use our latest 
course on the topic: *How to Use Git and GitHub*

We will be periodically reviewing the Front-End Nanodegree curriculum - both classes and projects - and making adjustments
based on student and industry feedback. We will notify active students working toward the Nanodegree about effects this may
have on the degree requirements.
