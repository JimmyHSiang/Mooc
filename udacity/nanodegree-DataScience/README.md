## Data Analyst Nanodegree

##Nanodegree Structure

These are the projects you'll build and the classes that will prepare you to build each of the projects. You'll have access to all these in the Nanodegree:

###Predict the New York City Subway Ridership

In this project, you will be exposed to and learn fundamental data science skills like data wrangling, applied statistics and machine learning, effective visualization, and working with big data using MapReduce. Specifically, you will pose a question about the New York City Subway and work with the subway ridership dataset to draw an interesting conclusion about the dataset itself.

Prepare for this project with: *Intro to Data Science*

**Wrangle OpenStreetMaps Data 
You will choose any area of the world in Open Street Map and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about.

Prepare for this project with: *Data Wrangling with MongoDB*

##Explore, Summarize, and Discover Interesting Insights from Datasets 
You will use R to apply exploratory data analysis techniques that you have learned to the project. You will practice understanding a single variable and relationships between multiple variables, and explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

Prepare for this project with: *Data Analysis with R*

##Identify Fraud from the Enron Email Dataset 
In this project, you will play detective, and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

Prepare for this project with: *Intro to Machine Learning*

##Tell Stories with Data Visualization 
For this project, you will create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or allows a reader to explore trends or patterns. Your work will be a reflection of the theory and best practices of data visualization.

Prepare for this project with: *Data Visualization*
