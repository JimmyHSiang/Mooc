Hey welcome!
I am Linus Torvalds and I started Linux in 1991 and I welcome you to Introduction to Linux course and (I) hope that you will get as much joy out of it, as I have gotten over these years.
One of the more interesting parts about Linux is how it turns out in the most unexpected places. So, when I started Linux I needed an operating system for my own use and today, you find Linux everywhere; in small embedded devices, super computers, and that is kind of interesting, how this technology allows you to expand into many different niches.
The thing that makes Linux interesting to me is all the interesting technology but itâ€™s also, all the people involved and working in an open source project, where you work with hundreds, potentially thousands of people makes the whole technology even more interesting.
Hopefully, this turns into an opportunity for you to find something you find really interesting to do. And, one of the nice things about Linux and open source in general is that there is a lot of different things, and everybody has something that he can give to the project.
Thank you for considering this course and have fun.
