##FEBRUARY 9, 2015

Start date:
The start date for the course has been set to Tuesday 24 February, at 9:00AM Pacific Standard Time, with a release of the material for Week 1. Every Tuesday after that the material for the next week will be released. There will be 9 problem sets, and a final exam, each due two weeks after being posted. The first 4 weeks require no special mathematical background. After that, we start learning and using Stochastic Calculus. Slight changes to the syllabus: there will be no restrictions on the number of attempts in the 9 problem sets; I also changed slightly the description of the course and when the "Show answer" button will appear for the problem sets.
Looking forward to it,
JC
